# Fantasy Game
A fantasy text-based adventure game. The Jaybird Renew Team refactored and expanded the original version. The new version has additional features: an expanded game world (the beanstalk and cloud world), additional NPC's (Rosie, Puss 'n' Boots, Jack), new puzzles to solve (giving the gumbo to the snowman, giving Rosie the ribbon, giving Jack the trumpet), colorized keywords for user discoverability, and more interactions with items (broom, trumpet, key, gate, beanstalk, snowman, monkey, passport). The new version also has refectored code that removed circular references, code coverage level increased from 0% to 40%, and wav files replaced with midis for an application compact enough for GitHub.
